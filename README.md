# EmailSpamClassifier


Email spam classification is the process of automatically identifying and categorizing emails as either "spam" (unsolicited or unwanted emails, often containing advertisements, scams, or phishing attempts) or "ham" (legitimate emails). This task is essential for managing email communication efficiently, as it helps users filter out unwanted messages and prioritize important ones.

Here's a general description of how email spam classification works:

1. Data Collection: The first step in building a spam classifier is to collect a dataset of labeled emails. These emails are typically labeled as either spam or non-spam (ham).

2. Data Preprocessing: Once the dataset is collected, preprocessing steps are applied to clean and prepare the text data. This may include tasks such as removing HTML tags, punctuation, stop words, and performing stemming or lemmatization to normalize the text.

3. Feature Extraction: The next step is to convert the text data into numerical feature vectors that can be used as input to machine learning algorithms. One common approach is to use techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text into numerical vectors while preserving the important information about word frequencies in documents.

4. Model Training: With the preprocessed and feature-extracted data, a machine learning model is trained on a portion of the dataset. Common algorithms used for spam classification include Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), logistic regression, and more recently, deep learning models like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

5. Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using a separate portion of the dataset that the model has not seen before. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess the performance of the model in classifying spam and ham emails.

6. Deployment: Once the model is trained and evaluated satisfactorily, it can be deployed into a production environment where it can automatically classify incoming emails in real-time.
